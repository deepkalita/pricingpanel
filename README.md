# Pricing Panel


This is my first mini project in CSS, and it's a pricing panel that showcases my skills in using Flexbox, Media Queries, CSS Grid, and Responsive Design. With this project, I aimed to create a modern and visually appealing pricing panel that can be easily customized to fit any business needs.


## Features


- Fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Built using CSS Grid, which makes it easy to create complex layouts with minimal code.
- Uses Flexbox to position and style individual elements within the pricing panel.
- Uses Media Queries to adjust the layout and styling for different devices and screen sizes.
- Effective use of CSS variables for easy color customization.
- Clean and semantic HTML markup, with appropriate use of headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- Effective use of ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to create decorative elements and animations.
- Easy to customize and extend, with well-structured and commented HTML and CSS code.


## Getting Started


To get started with the project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the **[pricingpanel.html](https://github.com/deepkalita/pricingpanel/blob/master/pricingPanel.html)** file in your web browser. You can then customize the pricing panel by modifying the HTML and CSS code to suit your needs.


## Credits


This project was inspired by various pricing panels found on the web, and I would like to thank the creators of those panels for their inspiration.
